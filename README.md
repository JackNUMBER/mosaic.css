# Mosaic.css
I build it with a matrix based on a number of column and lines.
Each classes are generated by the SASS mixin.

## How to use
You can pick the `mosaic.css` file if you want to start quickly.
* On each mosaic's tile, the `.tile` class is required.
* The `.tile-w-h` class defines the size of the tile (in number of column).
* The `.matx-x-y` class defines the position of the tile (origin is top-left).

## I want to custom your code
Do it!

You have to fork the source, install dependencies with:

    npm install

You can now edit the `mosaic.scss` file.
To build the CSS you just have to run:

    gulp sass

If you want to build automatically run:

    gulp watch
